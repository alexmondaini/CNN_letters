# CNN_letters
This is a personal project of which I implemented two differente CNN models to recognise pictures with handwritten letters ranging from A to D. File [CNN_train.py](CNN_train.py) has a model that is trained from sketch, while [pretrained_CNN_model.py] uses a pretrained model from MobileNetV2.
